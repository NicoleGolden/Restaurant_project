## Evolution of Food Prices at My Fav Pizza Place

Yes, inflation is here. As someone who has to order take-out food weekly, I defenitely feel the pinch since the lockdown in 2020. In this project, I collected food prices from my favoriate pizza place in Irvine. I used smooth lines to visualize the evolution of the price changes. 

## Data 

The data comes from my Doordash order record. Since pizza and dessert are the most ordered food types, I only made plots for these two types. In addition, I included food that was ordered more than once. 

The main variables are purchase date and the average prices for pizza or dessert for that purchase date. 

## Behold: How Much Have The Prices Increased since Lockdown in 2020? 

I plotted with raw data first.

Then I plotted with smoothed lines and indicated the price changes. For the pizza, the price increase is about 66%, and 33% increase for dessert!
